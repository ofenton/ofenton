## Some interesting blogs

 * Insights from [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/insights)

 * Martin Fowler's personal [blog](http://martinfowler.com/)

 * Engineering blogs from two Silicon valley companies that are doing engineering properly, [LinkedIn](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog) and [Netflix](http://techblog.netflix.com/) . LinkedIn particularly has interesting posts on scalability issues.

 * Tech blogs from [Twitter](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering) and  [Atlassian](http://blogs.atlassian.com/) aren't bad either.
